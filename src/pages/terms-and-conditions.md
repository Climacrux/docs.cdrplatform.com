## 2. Scope of Climacrux Services

Climacrux aims to help individuals and businesses towards carbon neutrality, including the offer of permanent removal of their emissions from the atmosphere. The websites with all information, tools and services available from the sites to you shall serve this aim and be the scope of Climacrux Services.

The service of permanent removal of greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere is referred to as greenhouse gas removal (GGR) and the removal of the specific greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, as carbon dioxide removal (CDR). GGR and CDR can be ordered via Climacrux Services and are subject to the order confirmation sent by the payment provider on behalf of Climacrux and these Terms. Detailed terms and conditions relating to Climacrux GGR and CDR are available in section 3.

## 3. Climacrux Greenhouse Gas and Carbon Dioxide Removal

Permanent removal of greenhouse gas and/or carbon dioxide emissions (also referred to as “footprint compensation”) is a process consisting of two parts: i) taking amounts of a greenhouse gas such as carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and ii) storing it permanently. Hereby this process shall be referred to as greenhouse gas removal (GGR). If the removed greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, the process shall be referred to as carbon dioxide removal (CDR). GGR and CDR shall not be confused with the general prevention or reduction of emissions, such as carbon credits e.g. preventing rainforests burning down, as this will reduce the total amount of man-made emissions but not remove already emitted greenhouse gases. There are several ways to perform GGR and CDR that include but are not limited to: planting trees; direct-air capture with storage; enhanced weathering; long term storage of bio-oil and biochar; blue carbon methods such as kelp sinking; carbon farming; and ocean fertilisation. Climacrux partners with third parties performing activities leading to removed greenhouse gas emissions, accumulating a quantity of removed greenhouse gas emissions to sell to customers.

Climacrux GGR and CDR Services can be purchased via a recurring, monthly subscription and via manual or automated individual transactions as described in sections 3.2 and 3.3.

### 3.1 Removal Quantity

The GGR and CDR amount is indicated in tonnes (t), kilograms (kg) or grams (g) CO2eq and can be freely chosen as made possible by the Services. Climacrux will make best efforts to ensure the removal of at least the amount of greenhouse gases – attributable to the customer - stated on the order confirmation.

The determination of the amount of GGR or CDR is not exact and its accuracy depends on the removal methods. Some methods - such as direct air capture and storage - offer high accuracy quantities of carbon removal for us to purchase. Other methods - such as tree planting - offer products or services that do not provide the exact amount of CO₂eq removed. In situations where the exact quantity of GGR or CDR is unavailable or unknown we will calculate the removed CO₂eq to the best of our ability.

Climacrux shall log the GGR or CDR Service quantity - amount of greenhouse gas removed from the atmosphere - with any third parties and record the GGR or CDR Service quantity attributable to each customer.

### 3.2 Subscription

Subscriptions allow users to continuously or regularly remove the selected GGR or CDR removal quantity over a determined period.

Paid subscriptions begin on the day the payment is received by us, unless otherwise agreed on.

In order to maintain subscriptions, users must pay the required recurring fee in a timely manner. Failure to do so may cause service interruptions or termination of the subscription. Subscription fees may be prepaid - e.g. annual invoices or gift certificates - for a set duration.

### 3.3 Individual transactions

Individual transactions are an order to remove the selected quantity of greenhouse gases in a single, non-recurring transaction.

### 3.4 Removal Duration

We endeavour to order the removal of the amount of GGR or CDR defined in the order confirmation within ninety (90) days of receiving payment. In certain situations, this may take up to six (6) months. In exceptional circumstances where ordering GGR or CDR is not possible within six months from a specific partner, Climacrux will continue to invest the allocated funds (as defined in Section 3.6.1) in removal methods/partners of equal or greater GGR or CDR amounts.

Rate of actual removal of CO2eq varies and finalised transactions are no guarantee that the defined amount of CO2 has been or will be removed from the atmosphere.

### 3.5 Certificate of Removal

As evidence of removal purchase, users will receive a removal certificate specifying the name of the customer; amount of CO2eq removed; date of certificate issuance and an identifier unique to each certificate.

Certificates will be issued within sixty (60) days of receiving payment and finalising a transaction.

### 3.6 Removal Price

The prices of the Service quantity quoted in the order confirmation shall apply. Additional Services shall be invoiced separately.

Additional fees such as taxes, currency conversion or payment fees may occur.

Prices for carbon removal fluctuate depending on a multitude of factors including, but not limited to, method used; volume of removal purchased; and maturity of method.

We will routinely review and revise prices for all customers to optimally support our portfolio of partners and deliver GGR or CDR. We reserve the right to change the prices displayed on the websites without warning at any time. Future purchases will be made at the most recent prices displayed on the websites. See section 7 for more information.

Users on an active subscription will never be charged a higher rate without seeking their prior permission. Completed purchases will not be modified to reflect any changes in prices.

### 3.7 Payment

When ordering through the Services, the payment of the amount charged for the provision of the Climacrux GGR or CDR Services (Climacrux GGR/CDR Service fee) is typically credit card based.

In the case of invoicing, payments are due within 30 (thirty) days of the invoice date and payment by customer is to be made to a bank account indicated by Climacrux. Any charges related to invoice amounts; delayed, returned or missing payments; are to be borne by the customer. Payment shall be considered to have been made on the day the payable sum is received by Climacrux.

Other payment methods will be supported only by prior agreement between the user and Climacrux.

### 3.8 Cancellation, Refunds and Returns

Cancellation and termination will apply to active subscriptions and incomplete individual transactions. The termination of a subscription by either party must be made at least five (5) working days before payment is due to be taken to guarantee new payment will not be collected. Should a termination be received later than this Climacrux will aim to stop collection of payment to the best of their ability, but no guarantee is provided.

Subscription plans may be terminated or updated at any time by sending a clear and unambiguous termination notice or update request to Climacrux. Terminations and updates will be processed by us within thirty (30) days of acknowledgment of receiving notice.

Climacrux is under no obligation to offer refunds for any completed transaction. Refunds will be considered only in exceptional circumstances and must be approved by Climacrux.

Due to the nature of GGR and CDR, returns are not possible.

### 3.9 Reselling

Reselling Climacrux GGR or CDR without prior agreement with Climacrux is strictly prohibited. Any account suspected of or found selling purchased GGR or CDR will have their account terminated without notice.

### 3.10 Reselling

Customers purchasing GGR or CDR Services or any other products offered on the websites - and where applicable, recipients of products such as gift cards - automatically opt-in to receive the newsletter. Newsletter subscribers have the possibility to unsubscribe at any time.

## Glossary

**CO₂eq:** Equivalent carbon dioxide (CO₂eq) is a distinct measure for estimating how much global warming a given type and amount of greenhouse gas may cause, using the functionally equivalent amount or concentration of carbon dioxide (CO₂) as the reference.
