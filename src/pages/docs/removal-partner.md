title: Partnering with companies removing CO₂
description: CDR Platform connects your business to a portfolio of reputable carbon dioxide removers.

## A diverse set of partners

We work with reputable partners using a variety of processes to create negative emissions. Currently each method has one partner that delivers the CDR for you.

{% callout title="How long does it take?" %}
Different removal methods have different delivery times. e.g. once bio-oil is injected, the carbon is captured; however it takes a tree 5 years to grow and sequester the requested CO₂.

More detailed information can be found in our docs for the [removal timeline](/docs/removal-timeline).

### Running Tide

Method: [Kelp sinking (Ocean based method)](/docs/removal-method#kelp-sinking)

Website: [https://www.runningtide.com/](https://www.runningtide.com/)

Grows natural kelp forests in the ocean that capture CO₂ as part of photosynthesis. Eventually the kelp sinks to the bottom of the ocean where the high pressures slow/stop the decomposition and the carbon dioxide is stored.

### Charm Industrial

Method: [Bio-oil underground injection](/docs/removal-method#bio-oil-underground-injection)

Website: [https://charmindustrial.com/](https://charmindustrial.com/)

Heats waste bio-mass to very high temperatures without oxygen (pyrolysis) turning the bio-mass into bio-oil. This bio-oil is then injected underground into deep caverns across the United States where it remains for millennia.

### Climeworks

Method: [Direct air capture and storage](/docs/removal-method#direct-air-capture-and-storage-dacs)

Website: [https://climeworks.com/](https://climeworks.com/)

Uses large fans and filters to capture carbon dioxide in Iceland before pumping it underground into Basalt rock where the CO₂ naturally reacts and turns into stone.

### Eden Reforestation

Method: [Forestation](/docs/removal-method#forestation)

Website: [https://www.edenprojects.org/](https://www.edenprojects.org/)

Plants trees and restores forests around the world helping rejuvenate natural ecosystems and capturing carbon dioxide.

### greenSand

Method: [Enhanced weathering (Olivine sand distribution)](/docs/removal-method#enhanced-weathering-olivine-distribution)

Website: [https://greensand.com/en](https://greensand.com/en)

Distributes tonnes of olivine sand throughout Europe that reacts with air & rain water and naturally sequesters carbon dioxide into silicate and carbonates.
