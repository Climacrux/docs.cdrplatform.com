## Pricing

Removing carbon dioxide from the athmosphere is not free. To remove your requested carbon we charge a price that consists of the **carbon removal cost** and **Climacrux' fees**.

The carbon removal cost consists of the sum of the cost to remove the amounts of CDR with the methods of your choice and goes to our removal partners without us taking a cut. The Climacrux' fees consist of a variable and a fixed part and covers currency conversion fees: tax: running costs - hosting, licences, administration, webpage maintenance and customper support; product improvement - partner acquisition, adding and improving features; and spreading the word to make a bigger impact.

In the response of the [price request API](/doc/api-reference) you can see the cost breakdown and total cost of the CDR you requested. The response will include the removal cost and variable part of the fee. The fixed fee will only be charged per invoice, not per request.

### Removal cost

The removal cost per ton differs between the [removal methods](/docs/removal-method):

- Forestation: 5.52$
- Direct air capture and storage: 1042.71$
- Kelp sinking: 250$
- Bio-oil underground injection: 600$
- Olivine distribution: 113.62$

The removal costs go to our removal partners.

### Climacrux' fee

The fee consists of a variable part and a fixed part. The variable part is 8% of the price you get back when requesting so that the removal cost is 92% and the fee 8% of the total cost shown.  
The flat part will be 10 CHF, USD, GBP or EUR and is only added for each invoice issued.

## Billing

We will bundle all your [removal requests](/docs/removal-request) over the month and then issue an invoice for that month in the start of the following month. On each invoice the flat fee will be added only once - not per removal request. The invoice will be only sent if a treshhold of 100 CHF, USD, GBP or EUR is crossed. If that is not the case we will bundle your requests over several months until the treshhold is exceeded. The invoice will be sent to the organisations billing contact.

Only after the invoice has been paid, we will order the CDR from our partners.

Paying via bank transfer has no additional cost. Paying via Stripe has an additional cost of 2.9% of the total amount - a payment link will be sent with the invoice and with this link you can pay via credit or depit card.
