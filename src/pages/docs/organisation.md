## Multiple users in an organisation

An organisation is a collection of users that can make price and purchase requests for carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Each organisation needs to provide a billing contact that the invoices will be sent to and so that they can purchase the requested CDR. Learn more about pricing and billing [here](/docs/pricing-and-billing).

Of course it is also okay to have only one user in an organisation.

## Accessing the API

To access the API, an organisation needs to have a minimum of one API key but can have multiple. Learn more about [how to get an API key and how to authenticate](/docs/authentication-and-security) in our docs.
