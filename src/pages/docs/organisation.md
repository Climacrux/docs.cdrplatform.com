An organisation is a collection of users that can make price and purchase requests for carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Each organisation needs to provide a billing contact, so that they can purchase the requested CDR. Learn more about [pricing and billing here](/docs/pricing-and-billing).

Of course it is also okay to have only one user in an organisation.

Organisations need minimum one API key but can have multiple. Learn more about [how to get an API key and how to authenticate here.](/docs/authentication)
