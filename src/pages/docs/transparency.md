## Carbon removal purchases

Climacrux publishes all of their carbon removal purchases from their partners so they can be verified by yourself or other third parties. A full list can be found in this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ajdfvSHyK3pb_X0GhpAso1wS0iw8BYpa86EtTG6QEY/edit).

### Example

We have provided a few records from our complete purchase transparency ledger of over 900 tonnes.

### For your removal requests

Currently we do not specifically associate your removal request with a carbon removal purchase however this is on our road map for the future for end-to-end verification.
