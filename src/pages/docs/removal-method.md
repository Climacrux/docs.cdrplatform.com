title: Carbon removal methods
description: A short overview of what a CO₂ removal method is and some examples of ways to remove carbon dioxide through our platform.

## Definition

Carbon dioxide removal (CDR), CO₂ removal or carbon removal refers to the human-driven extraction of the greenhouse gas CO₂ from the atmosphere combined with long-term storage. The goal of carbon removal procedures is to decrease atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and to mitigate or even reverse man-made global warming.

## Assessment of removal methods

To qualify as carbon removal method we evaluate possible solutions based on the following criteria:

| Criteria                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Result in negative emissions | The removal method must capture and store more carbon dioxide than is produced by it's construction and operation.                                                                                             |
| Long term storage            | Captured CO₂ must be locked away for the long-term. Any captured gas that is used for industrial purposes (e.g. for carbonated drinks) is released back into the atmosphere, therefore not negative emissions. |
| Be additional                | The process must not have taken place anyway without the purchasing of the carbon removal. Essentially meaning that this method only works because we are purchasing from it.                                  |

These points are generally calculated and assessed in complex life-cycle analysis - that is often verified by independent third parties - so that we can be sure a removal method matches the above criteria.

{% callout  title="Making sure negative emissions really are negative" %}
All negative emissions purchased result from _after_ the removal of any emissions from the construction and operation of a method. e.g. if a removal method sequesters 8 tonnes of carbon dioxide but it needed to generate 3 tonnes to do so, only the remaining 5 tonnes are available to purchase.

## Different methods

There is no "silver bullet" or single method that has the potential to reverse the volume of CO₂ that has been emitted over the last centuries. We believe in supporting a variety of approaches to remove carbon and aim to make as many as possible available through the CDR Platform.

### Forestation

Trees naturally sequester carbon dioxide to convert into what they are made of - biomass.

### Direct air capture and storage (DACS)

### Kelp sinking

### Bio-oil underground injection

### Enhanced weathering (e.g. Olivine distribution)

### Biochar
