## Definition

Carbon dioxide removal (CDR), CO₂ removal or carbon removal refers to the human-driven extraction of the greenhouse gas CO₂ from the atmosphere combined with its permanent storage. The goal of carbon removal procedures is to decrease atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and to mitigate or even reverse man-made global warming.

## Assessment of removal methods

To qualify as removal method, the process has to produce negativ emissions, the greenhouse gas has to be stored away long-term and additionality is required.

## Different methods

There is no silver bullet. We belive in supporting a variety of approaches to remove carbon:

### Forestation

Trees naturally sequester carbon dioxide to convert into what they are made of - biomass.

### Direct air capture and storage

### Kelp sinking

### Bio-oil underground injection

### Olivine distribution

### Biochar
