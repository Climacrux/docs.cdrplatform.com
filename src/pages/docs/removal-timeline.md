{% callout title="You should know!" %}
We differ between **kick-off time** and **completed time**. Removing carbon takes different amount of time, depending on the method. Kick-off time is when the removal partner starts to produce the negative emissions and completed time is when the production is completed and the carbon removed permanently.
