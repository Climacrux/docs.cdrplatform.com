## Timing factors

Capturing and storing carbon dioxide is not an immediate process and can take time. To bring as much transparency to the process as possible we would like to explain the factors that can influence the delivery time and provide some expectations as to how long it can take.

### Partner capacities

The carbon removal industry is in it's infancy and as removal partners start out they generally have limited capacity that can be delivered each year.

For example, the largest DACS plant can capture and store 4,000 tonnes per year. Bio-oil injection capacity is another 5,000+ tonnes per year. These are small numbers but the companies are becoming more efficient and scaling up.

### CDR delivery time

Once the carbon removal has been kicked-off by our partners (trees planted, bio-mass 'melted' to bio-oil, olivine sand spread etc.), each method then requires some time to be able capture and store the carbon dioxide.

For example, after planting trees they will take 5 years to grow, photosynthesize and sequester the requested amount of carbon dioxide.

Further down [this page](#differences-between-methods) you can find a reference of timing per method.

## Removal process and timeline

Below you can find the steps involved and an approximate duration from requesting CO₂ removal via the API to delivery of that CDR.

| CDR kick-off                 | Months-Years | Depending on the partner capacity and removal method it may take anywhere from a few months to a year or two before starting the removal of your carbon dioxide.                                                                                                              |
| CDR completion               | Days-Years   | Some methods are able to immediate deliver the CDR (e.g. bio-oil injection means the CO₂ is immediately locked away), however other methods may take years to fully sequester CO₂ (e.g. forestation - trees take 5 years to grow and sequester the requested carbon dioxide). |

{% callout title="You should know!" %}
We differ between _kick-off_ time and _completed_ time. Removing carbon takes different amounts of time depending on the method.

**Kick-off time** is when the removal partner starts to produce the negative emissions.

**Completed time** is when the production is completed and the carbon dioxide is permanently removed.
