## API keys for authentication

To use the CDR API the user needs an API key. Each API key is linked to an organisation and serves to authenticate the organisation.

---

## Getting an API key

Request an API key via following form: PLACEHOLDER-API-KEY-FORM

{% callout title="You should know!" %}
You will only see your API key once at the time of creation. So make sure you save it.
{% /callout %}

---

## Using the API key

---

## Security

{% callout type="warning" title="Oh no! Something bad happened!" %}
Make sure you keep the API secret. Don't share it with anyone or post it publicly online.
{% /callout %}

We don't know your API key either.
