## We believe in open source

Both our [API](https://github.com/Climacrux/api.cdrplatform.com) and [documentation](https://github.com/Climacrux/docs.cdrplatform.com) are open source and available on GitHub.

If you are comfortable working with open source projects please feel free to select the relevant repository for your bug/feature request and open an issue directly.

## Responsible disclosure

If you have found a security vulnerability please do not post a public issue, instead reach out to us directly at [hello@cdrplatform.com](mailto:hello@cdrplatform.com) and we will address this straight away.

Thank you in advance!
