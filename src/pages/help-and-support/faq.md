## Methodology

### How do I know my CO₂ is actually removed?

### What partners do you use?

### Is this just carbon credits?

No.

### Can I be "net-zero" with this?

Actually yes.

Quick recap: "net-zero" refers to there being a result of zero emissions in the atmosphere from your activities.

i.e. if you emit one tonne of carbon dioxide, you must remove that one tonne again so the net result is zero emissions.

You cannot reduce emissions elsewhere and have the same result as your emissions are still out there.

## Technology

### Is this on the blockchain?

No. We don't "tokenize" or include our certificates on the blockchain and we do not encourage anyone to do so.

The blockchain is an exciting technology but we don't see it adding any additional value here.

Should you disagree and think we could improve by doing so please [contact us](/contact-us) with more information.

### What technologies do you use?

That's a multi-faceted question so we'll break it down like this:

#### For the carbon dioxide removal:

_We do not currently remove ourselves however we partner with a portfolio of partners who are using both nature and cutting edge technologies. Check out [our removal partners](#what-partners-do-you-use) for more info._

#### For our platform:

- We use Python + Django for the API;
- SQLite for the database;
- Redis to cache and speed up the site;
- Hetzner servers to host;
- NextJS + TailwindUI for our documentation;
- Cloudflare to accelerate delivery;

## Mission

### Aren't "the rich"/"China"/"corporations" causing all the problems?

We're sorry to tell you but this is often an easy-way-out argument.

### This is just an excuse to continue emitting, right?

Wrong. We know that not emitting is the best approach. Carbon removal and emissions reductions are not mutually exclusive - we need to do both!

But...we also cannot achieve this overnight. Plus we already have an excess of emissions in the atmosphere.

However we can do both at the same time and we have chosen to help accelerate the development and adoption of CO₂ removal.

### But this is just greenwashing?

## Miscellaneous

### What else can I do to help the environment?

### Aren't there other problems humanity is facing?

Yes - sadly. There are a multitude of environmental problems that humanity is facing however we have chosen (currently) to focus on capturing and removing carbon dioxide with the aim of limiting - and possibly reducing - the effects of climate change on the natural world.

We encourage you to research and support as many ways to help the environment as you can. (This doesn't have to be financial - see below).

### I have no money - what can I do?

### Why so expensive?

Our prices are predominantly set by the price of the carbon dioxide removal method (as we only add a small margin on top). These prices are higher than your typical "carbon credit" prices because they are actually capturing and removing CO₂.

Think of it this way: It's easier (and therefore cheaper...) to not burn a piece of wood rather than to reverse the process of burning it.

### Is climate change even real?

Realistically if you're asking this question this product isn't for you. But yes, the changing of the climate is real.

Increased CO₂ (+ other greenhouse gases) in the atmosphere are trapping heat, raising the temperature of the earth and causing incredible damage to the natural world around us that we depend on.

We're not here to convince you of this fact - there are plenty resources available to do that - but we hope you do continue to see what's evolving around you and begin to accept the fact that climate change is real and that you will need to adapt your behaviour to deal with it.
