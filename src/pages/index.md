What is CDR, why do we need it, and how can you easily make it an integral part of your business? {% .lead %}

## What is CDR?

Carbon dioxide removal (CDR), CO₂ removal or carbon removal refers to the human-driven extraction of the greenhouse gas CO₂ from the atmosphere combined with its permanent storage. The goal of carbon removal procedures is to decrease atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and to mitigate or even reverse man-made global warming.

---

## Why do we need CDR?

With their latest report, the IPCC has noted that reductions alone are unlikely to be enough to limit a global temperature increase to 1.5ºC. Instead we, as a global population, will need to invest into carbon dioxide removals to capture and store CO₂ from the atmosphere.

More and more people are recognising that CDR is a crucial part of reaching the goal of net-zero emissions.

Across the world governments and businesses are setting themselves net-zero targets. These involve both reducing emissions but also removing any unavoidable emissions (hence the term "net zero emissions").

---

## Why integrate CDR into your business?

Apart from the moral responsibility to try to do our part to fix the climate, offering a sustainable option to your customers can also act as a differentiator to your competitors with some positive marketing benefits.

Reaching net-zero doesn't have to involve a lot of effort or high costs. Instead we want to make it as easy and affordable as possible to make 'little-but-often' contributions to fight the climate crisis and achieve your net-zero goals.

## Isn't this just carbon credits?

No. Net-zero targets cannot be met with carbon credits as credits do not remove any emitted CO₂. Instead they reduce emissions elsewhere - some examples include solar cooking for refugees; avoiding deforestation; or healthy homes.

Purchasing carbon credits will support vulnerable communities and help them reduce their emissions. However, your emissions will still be in the atmosphere until they are removed.

Carbon removal takes carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and captures it in long-term storage with the goal of lowering the global CO₂ level back to natural ranges (for context, we're over 30% higher than natural expectations).

{% callout title="CDR is not a substitute for avoiding emissions!" %}
Carbon removal is not a substitute for avoiding emissions in the first place. However we need time to reach a zero-emissions future so we must accelerate the adoption of CDR while simultaneously drastically reducing emissions.

## Some example use cases

Nobody knows your business better than you but we have included a few potential use cases to inspire you on your journey to net-zero.

### Footprint calculator or environmental consultancies

After your customers have calculated their carbon footprint using your tool or service, you could integrate carbon removal as an easy next-step to meet their net-zero targets.

### E-commerce, marketplaces & transactions

Do you ship products? Your customers may be interested in having the option to remove the footprint of their product or even just the shipping.

In fact any type of transaction can help support CDR:

- You could round up a payment transaction to the nearest $ and put that money towards removing carbon;
- 1% of your monthly spend could be automatically deducted and put towards becoming net-zero;
- Even just committing to purchase 1g for every $1 spent or 1kg per transaction can make a difference.

### Corporate finances

The accounting department is often the single source of truth in a business. Why not connect with them to remove the emissions of all corporate travel & events or the footprint of their employees?
